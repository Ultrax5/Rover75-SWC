# Rover75-SWC
Requirements:
- any linux-based development board (Raspberry Pi, Hardkernel Odroid, etc.)
- 13k ohm and 1.5k ohm resistors for the voltage dividers
- ADC1x15 ADC
- electical cables
The script reads the current voltage measured between the steering wheel control leads continuously, measuing the voltage drop after a keypress and firing up actions based on that. Accounts for different voltages (engine running/not running).
